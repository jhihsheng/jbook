    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Before performing the below steps, ensure that HTML has been built for each page of your book\n",
    "(see {doc}`the previous section <../start/build>`). There should be a collection of HTML\n",
    "files in your book's `_build/html` folder.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install `ghp-import`\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install ghp-import\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Update the settings for your GitHub pages site:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Use the `gh-pages` branch to host your website.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Choose root directory `/` if you're building the book in it's own repository.\n",
    "       Choose `/docs` directory if you're building documentation with jupyter-book.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From the `main` branch of your book's root directory (which should contain the `_build/html` folder) call `ghp-import` and point it to your HTML files, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html\n",
