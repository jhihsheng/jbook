## Oscillating dipole in vacuum 

In vaccum, an oscillating dipole $\mathbf{p}(t)  = p_0 e^{i\omega t} \hat{y}$ will radiate electromagnetic wave mainly in the orthogoanl directions ($\hat{x}$ and $\hat{z}$). The energy of the dipole is then emitted to the infinity. This energy loss of an oscillating dipole is related to the spontaneous emission. The radiated waves have a wavelength $\lambda_0 = \frac{c}{\omega}$.

## Oscillating dipole above a metal film

A metal film supports surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). An oscillating dipole still emits energy, but 
this time, most of the energy goes to the SPPs. The wavelength $\lambda_p$ of SPPs is much shorter than $\lambda_0$. This is why plasmonics can do sub-wavelength tasks and the core part of nano-optics.
