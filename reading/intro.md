# Reading Literature 
Finding and reading the literatures is important for research, and more generally to solve an open problem.
Knowledges are built upon the shoulders of the past giants. The process of a problem solving is to build a hierachy of knowledges. For a master student, you will have to read about 200 papers in two years. 
Among them, you should be familiar with 30 to 50 papers, and fully understand the details of 5 to 10 core papers, which are most related to your research thesis.
